A specification of the ICM-CD2 display media

Summary
{
	
	The ICM-CD2 display media is a backwards-compatible display media with a modern square screen capable of reproducing 16 colors in a single image.
	Colors can be specified by software choosing from an 8-bit color space.
}

Streaming Modes
{
	
	The ICM-CD2 supports two streaming display modes, Compatible and Wide.
	These modes are designed to be compatible with legacy devices. These are character-display modes, and use no color data.
	These modes require no mapped memory.
	Every 8-bit value written to the device is displayed immediately upon the screen.
}

Palette
{
	
	The ICM-CD2 has an internal palette of up to 16 colors. 
	The display is capable of reproducing 256 distinct colors, and can display 16 of these colors at once.
	While the palette is always 16 bytes long, in display modes of less than 16 colors, only a portion of
		the palette is used.

	Color bit format
	[000][000][00]

	   |   L Green component
	   L Red component
	

I/O Port Specification
{
	
	The ICM-CD2 connects to a standard serial port. It communicates with the host device using two I/O ports which shall be called 
		ports A and B.
	Port B is used to send commands. Port A is used to send data.
	Port numbers are assigned by the host device and cannot be modified.

	Command Code 			Effect
	0x01 					Change mode
	0x02 					Map memory
	0x03 					Refresh; Clears streaming modes.
	0xF0-0xFF 				Set palette

	Changine the display mode
	{
		Write the number of the mode desired to port A.
		Then write the command code 0x01 to port B.
	}

	Mapping memory
	{
		Write the page to begin mapping at to port A.
		Then write the command code 0x02 to port B.
		The size of the mapped memory is determined by the current display mode.
		Mapping modes are only available on supported devices, and when the display is connected to the device by an extended bus.
		The device may not function if the memory needed extends beyond the mappable memory of the host device.
	}

	Refresh the display
	{
		Write the command code 0x03 to port B.
		This will cause the display to update.
	}

	Setting the palette
	{
		Write the color data to set to port A.
		Then write the command code (0xF0 + desired palette position) to port B.
		For example, to set color 0, write 0xF0 to port B.
		To set color 1, write 0xF1, and so on.
	}

	To display text in streaming modes
	{
		Write the 8-bit character code to port A.
		The ICM-CD2 supports a 7-bit character set. The high-bit of character data sent is ignored.
	}
